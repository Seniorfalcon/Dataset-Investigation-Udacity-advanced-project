In this project, we will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.
we will conduct our own data analysis and create a file to share that documents findings. 
we started by taking a look at a dataset and brainstorming what questions we could answer using it. Then we used pandas and NumPy to answer the questions we were most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. 
we would not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but we have to make it clear in your communications that  our findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.
